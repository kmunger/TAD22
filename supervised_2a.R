##don't worry about that code






#########Practice questions:

# 1. We originally set the proportion of the training set to be .8 --- what happens to performance when we set it at .2? Re-run all the code 
##after that point (with smoothing)



# 2. Read the help file about textmodel_nb . What does the "prior" argument do in Naive Bayes? What is the default value for this 
# argument in quanteda?


#3.TODO THURSDAY Re-run the code with prior = "docfreq". Think about the proportions of classes in the dataset. How should this affect your outcome?
# Looking at the results of the code, were you right?
