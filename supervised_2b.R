# We're using all but one manifesto as a "reference text" --- this isn't how wordscores is supposed to work!


# 1. The farthest left Labour manifesto was in 1983. Re-run the model using only the labour and conservative manifestos from 1983 as 
# reference texts


#2. Predict the rest of the manifestos this way

#3. Other than the reference texts, which are the most extreme?
